      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions and solutions on group theory. I tried to be as detailed as possible. Click on the question to see the solution. Credits to Gabriele Pinna for working on these problems with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prove that the alternating group (even permutations) $A_n$ has order $\frac{n!}{2}$.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the order of the symmetric group (aka all permutations) $S_n$, is $n!$. We also learned that any permutation $\pi \in S_n$ can be written as a product of transpositions, which, if there are even number of them, then $\pi$ is an even permutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that we call $A_n$ the alternating &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt;, we can see that it is one, since identity $e=(12)(21)$ and a product of two even permutations are even, since the number of transpositions will add. We know that there are odd permutations too, so we know that $A_n$ is a subgroup of $S_n$, i.e. $A_n \subset S_n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we have not shown &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; elements in $A_n$ there are. How to show this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our strategy will be to do a coset decomposition of $S_n$, then use Lagrange&amp;rsquo;s theorem. We will find that there are only two coset representatives (these are elements that label the disjoint cosets), so that there are exactly half the elements of $S_n$ in $A_n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we know that $A_n e = A_n$ is a valid right coset, and will contain all the even permutations in $S_n$. Let&amp;rsquo;s choose some odd permutation $d \in S_n$ as the next coset representative. We want to check that $A_n d$ contains the rest of $S_n$. Consider some other odd element $d&amp;rsquo; \in S_n$. Then $A_n d&amp;rsquo; = A_n d&amp;rsquo; d^{-1} d$. But $d&amp;rsquo; d^{-1}$ is an even permutation, since the number of transpositions will add and an odd number plus another odd number is an even number. Therefore $A_n d&amp;rsquo; = A_n d$. So we see that $A_n d$ contains &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the odd elements in $S_n$. All elements in $A_n d$ must be odd. So $A_n e$ and $A_n d$ are disjoint since the former contains only even elements and $A_n d$ contain only the odd elements, and $S_n = A_n e \cup A_n d$. There are two coset representatives, so $\lvert S_n \rvert = 2 \lvert A_n \rvert \implies \lvert A_n \rvert = n!/2$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;For a group $G$ that has an action on a finite set $S$, such that $\forall g \in G$, $g(i) \in S$, let the stabiliser subgroup of $x$ given group $G$ be defined as 
  $$\mathrm{Stab}_G(i) := \left\{ \phi \in G \vert \phi(i) = i\right\}.$$
  Let the orbit of of an element $i \in S$ given group $G$ be
  $$\mathrm{Orb}_G(i) := \left\{ g(i) \vert g \in G \right\}.$$
  Prove that for any $i$,
  $$\lvert G \rvert = \lvert \mathrm{Orb}_G(i) \rvert \lvert \mathrm{Stab}_G(i) \rvert.$$
  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fixed element $i$, let&amp;rsquo;s denote $H = \mathrm{Stab}_G(i)$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ (you should check this), let us consider the left coset decomposition of $G$:
$$G = t_1 H \cup t_2 H \cup \cdots \cup t_n H,$$
where $t_1 = e$, the identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can write the orbit as
$$\mathrm{Orb}_G(i) = \bigcup_{a=1}^n \left\{ g(i) | g \in t_a H \right\}.$$
We can also iterate over each coset like
$$\mathrm{Orb}_G(i) = \bigcup_{a=1}^n \left\{ t_a(\phi(i)) | h \in H \right\}.$$
Since all $\phi(i) = i$, and sets only count &lt;b&gt;unique&lt;/b&gt; elements, we only have one element contributing from each coset at most, so
$$\mathrm{Orb}_G(i) = \bigcup_{a=1}^n \left\{ t_a(i) \right\} = \left\{ t_a(i) \vert a=1, \dots, n\right\}.$$
We&amp;rsquo;re almost there, since if $t_a(i)$ are unique with $a$, then we see that $\mathrm{Orb}_G(i)$ counts the number of cosets, so we can use Lagrange&amp;rsquo;s theorem to prove the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check this. Assume there exists $t_a(i) = t_b(i)$ where $a \neq b$. Then $t_b^{-1} (t_a(i)) = i$ so $t_b^{-1} t_a = h$. This means that $t_a = t_b h$ so $t_a H = t_b H$, so are the same cosets. But this is a contradiction because $t_a H$ and $t_b H$ were supposed to be disjoint. So $t_a(i)$ are unique.&lt;/p&gt;
